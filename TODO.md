# TODO Log (Exo-Cortex Write-Ahead Intent)

This file tracks all pending, in-progress, and recently completed tasks, decisions, and rationale for the MoMo Merchant App project. All Operators must update this log before and after significant actions, per INSTRUCTIONS.md.

## [2025-09-02] Session Start (Operator: GitHub Copilot)

### Intent

- Ensure project is compliant with Exo-Cortex protocols: logging, TODOs, and Git versioning.
- Fix onboarding screen bugs and prepare for UI/UX enhancements.

### Rationale

- INSTRUCTIONS.md mandates externalized logs, TODOs, and session summaries for all work.
- Onboarding screens are critical for first-time user experience and must be robust.

### Expected Outcome

- TODO log created and visible in repo.
- Onboarding screens are bug-free and ready for further UI/UX work.

### Alternatives Considered

- Continue without explicit TODO log (rejected: non-compliant with protocol).

## TODO

- [ ] Review all onboarding screens for UI/UX consistency and accessibility.

- [ ] Commit all changes with Conventional Commits.
- [ ] Review and update documentation as needed.
