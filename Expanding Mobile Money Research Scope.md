## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the viability of launching a merchant-focused mobile money application in four key Sub-Saharan African markets: Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda. The analysis is based on a deep-dive investigation into the respective mobile money agent ecosystems, focusing on operational realities, existing technology, and regulatory frameworks to identify strategic market entry points and product opportunities.

The core finding of this analysis is that the mobile money agent landscape across these key markets, while diverse in structure—ranging from the mobile network operator (MNO)-led models in East Africa to the fintech-led ecosystem in Nigeria—presents a universal and acute set of operational challenges. These challenges are primarily concentrated in three areas: liquidity management, business record-keeping, and fraud prevention. Existing digital tools provided by dominant operators inadequately address these fundamental pain points, creating a significant and addressable market opportunity for a superior, agent-centric solution.

Based on this analysis, a phased market entry strategy is recommended. The initial launch should prioritize **Nigeria**, owing to its immense market scale, rapid growth, and a dynamic competitive environment that is receptive to third-party fintech innovation. This should be followed by **Kenya**, a mature market with high digital literacy where the proven reliability gaps in incumbent solutions create a clear opening for a more robust product. **Tanzania** and **Uganda** represent attractive subsequent expansion targets, characterized by similar agent challenges and less developed ecosystems of dedicated business management tools.

The primary opportunity lies in developing an integrated business management application designed to solve the "Three Pillars" of agent pain points. The core value proposition is to deliver a tool that enhances agent efficiency, profitability, and security. Success is contingent on developing a highly reliable, user-friendly application that integrates seamlessly into the agent's daily workflow. The application must be meticulously tailored to the unique regulatory and competitive dynamics of each target market, positioning it not merely as another transaction app, but as an indispensable partner for the mobile money agent's business success.

## **Section 1: The Sub-Saharan Africa Mobile Money Landscape: A Strategic Overview**

### **1.1 The Unassailable Epicenter of Global Mobile Money**

Sub-Saharan Africa stands as the undisputed global leader in the mobile money industry, representing a market of unparalleled scale, activity, and growth. This dominance provides the foundational context for any strategic investment in the region's digital financial services sector. In 2024, Africa processed an estimated 65% of the world's total mobile money transaction value, amounting to over $1.1 trillion.1 This financial throughput is driven by an even more impressive share of transaction volume; the continent accounted for approximately 74% of all global mobile money activity, with 81.8 billion transactions processed.1

This transactional velocity is supported by a massive and expanding user base. By the end of 2024, Africa was home to over one billion registered mobile money accounts, representing 53% of all mobile money wallets globally.3 The number of active users—those transacting within a 30-day window—stood at 286 million, or 56% of the world's total.3 This scale has been achieved with remarkable speed; while the industry took 18 years to reach its first billion registered accounts globally, it doubled that figure to two billion in just the subsequent five years, with Africa driving a substantial portion of this acceleration.5

Despite its scale, the market continues to exhibit robust, double-digit growth, signaling sustained momentum and untapped potential. Across the continent, the value of mobile money transactions grew by 15% year-on-year in 2024, while the volume of transactions surged by 22%.1 This sustained expansion underscores a deep and continuously growing reliance on mobile money platforms for daily financial life.

### **1.2 Economic Engine and Financial Inclusion Driver**

The impact of mobile money in Sub-Saharan Africa extends far beyond transactional convenience; it has become a powerful engine for economic growth and the primary catalyst for financial inclusion. The sector's contribution to regional economies is substantial, with mobile money activity adding an estimated $190 billion to Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP in 2023 alone.1 This economic impact highlights the systemic importance of the mobile money infrastructure to national financial stability and development.

More fundamentally, mobile money is the principal mechanism through which millions of previously unbanked and underbanked individuals are accessing formal financial services for the first time. According to the World Bank, the share of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa with a formal financial account (with a bank or mobile money provider) rose to 58.2% in 2024, more than double the rate from a decade prior.4 This growth is explicitly attributed to mobile money, with 40% of the region's adults now owning a mobile money account, a significant increase from 27% in 2021\.4 This rapid adoption has enabled a dramatic rise in formal savings, with the share of adults saving through formal channels increasing by 12 percentage points between 2021 and 2024\.7

A critical shift is occurring in the nature of mobile money usage, signaling a maturation of the market. While early growth was driven by large, infrequent transactions like remittances, recent data shows a trend towards smaller, more frequent payments.6 This indicates that mobile money is becoming more deeply embedded in the fabric of daily commerce, used for everything from purchasing groceries to paying for transport. This behavioral evolution from a simple money transfer utility to an everyday payment platform suggests the market is moving past the initial phase of user acquisition and into a new stage focused on deepening engagement and increasing the lifetime value of its user base. For service providers, the strategic focus is naturally shifting from simply signing up new customers to encouraging a wider range of transactions and offering more sophisticated financial products like credit, savings, and insurance.2 This creates a fertile environment for value-added tools, such as a merchant application, that can enhance the efficiency and capability of the ecosystem's core participants.

### **1.3 The Agent Network: The Indispensable Last Mile**

At the heart of Sub-Saharan Africa's mobile money success story is the agent network—a sprawling, indispensable infrastructure of small-scale entrepreneurs who serve as the bridge between the cash and digital economies. These agents are the backbone of the entire ecosystem, performing the critical functions of cash-in (depositing physical cash into a mobile wallet) and cash-out (withdrawing digital funds as physical cash).8 They are the primary, and often only, physical touchpoint for millions of customers, responsible for onboarding new users, providing technical support, and building trust in the system.9 In the eyes of the customer, the agent

_is_ the face of the mobile money provider.8

The scale of this human infrastructure far surpasses that of traditional banking. In many African markets, there are over 10 times more registered mobile money agents than traditional bank branches.11 Globally, the density of the agent network is 20 times greater than that of bank branches and seven times that of ATMs, providing unparalleled "last-mile" access to financial services, particularly in rural and remote areas.9 This extensive physical footprint represents the single greatest competitive advantage of MNO-led mobile money services and is the key enabler of their mass-market adoption.11

It is crucial to recognize that these agents are not employees but independent small business owners. Their livelihood depends on the commissions earned from facilitating transactions, making their business viability a key determinant of the overall health and reliability of the mobile money ecosystem.9 Globally, over 5.2 million agents rely on this activity as a primary or significant source of income.9 Therefore, understanding their daily operational challenges, profitability, and business needs is fundamental to developing any successful service targeted at this segment. Their success and efficiency directly translate into a better, more reliable service for the end consumer, reinforcing the entire value chain.

## **Section 2: Market Selection & Prioritization: Identifying Viable Ecosystems**

### **2.1 Methodology for Market Selection**

The selection of Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda as the primary markets for this analysis is based on a strategic evaluation of key indicators that signal a high potential for the successful launch of a merchant-focused mobile money application. The criteria used for this selection include:

- **High Mobile Money Penetration:** Each country demonstrates significant adoption and usage of mobile money services, ensuring a large, established base of both end-users and agents.
- **Substantial Transaction Volumes:** The scale of digital transactions in these markets confirms a deep integration of mobile money into their respective economies.
- **Established Agent Networks:** All four countries possess vast and active agent networks, which are the primary target users for the proposed application.
- **Varying but Navigable Regulatory Environments:** The markets feature diverse regulatory frameworks, from the mature and well-defined rules in Kenya to the dynamic and evolving landscape in Nigeria. All possess functioning regulatory bodies and established guidelines for agent banking, providing a basis for market entry and compliance.

### **2.2 Comparative Market Analysis**

Before conducting a deep-dive analysis, a high-level comparison of the four target markets reveals distinct archetypes and strategic considerations.

- **Kenya** represents the **pioneer market**. It is a mature ecosystem dominated by a single MNO, Safaricom, whose M-Pesa platform has achieved near-total market saturation.12 With the highest banked population in Sub-Saharan Africa at 90.1% and a highly digitized populace where 89% of adults conducted digital payments in 2024, Kenya offers a glimpse into the future of a fully developed mobile money economy.4
- **Nigeria** is the **high-growth fintech arena**. As Africa's most populous nation, its mobile money boom is being driven not by MNOs, but by agile, venture-backed fintech companies like OPay and PalmPay.13 While its overall financial inclusion rate is lower at 63%, it is rising at an explosive pace, up from 45% in just three years.4 The market is defined by intense competition and a rapidly evolving, and at times complex, regulatory landscape.16
- **Tanzania** can be characterized as the **established follower**. It is a strong mobile money market where Vodacom's M-Pesa also holds a leading position with a 40.4% market share, but it faces more robust competition from other MNOs like Tigo Pesa and Airtel Money.12 Its regulatory environment is actively evolving, with the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) recently introducing a fintech regulatory sandbox to encourage innovation.20
- **Uganda** emerges as the **rising star**. It is a market with a high level of digital engagement, where 71% of adults use digital platforms and the banked population stands at a strong 72.8%.4 The ecosystem is a competitive duopoly between MTN MoMo and Airtel Money.13 Its regulatory framework is widely considered to be progressive and supportive of innovation, fostering a healthy environment for new financial technology solutions.22

The following table provides a side-by-side comparison of these key market indicators, offering a snapshot of their relative strengths and characteristics.

## **Section 3: Deep-Dive Analysis of Target Agent Ecosystems**

### **3.1 Kenya: The Mature Pioneer**

#### **Market & Operator Landscape**

Kenya is the cradle of the mobile money revolution, a market defined by the unparalleled success of Safaricom's M-Pesa. Launched in 2007, M-Pesa has transcended its status as a financial service to become an integral part of the national economic fabric, used by individuals in 96% of Kenyan households.13 The platform's financial dominance is staggering; in 2024, M-Pesa's revenues surpassed $1 billion, contributing over 42% of Safaricom's total service revenue.3 This deep market penetration has created a powerful network effect, making the M-Pesa ecosystem the de facto standard for digital payments in the country.

The foundation of this dominance is M-Pesa's vast and meticulously structured agent network. Safaricom has cultivated a network of over 130,000 active agents, a figure that dwarfs the approximately 15,000 agents deployed by all of Kenya's leading banks combined.11 This network operates on a hierarchical model, with a layer of "super-agents" or "master agents" responsible for managing the liquidity and operations of a vast number of smaller "sub-agents".14 It is at this sub-agent level—in small kiosks, retail shops, and neighborhood stores—that the vast majority of customer interactions, such as cash-in and cash-out, take place. This structure has proven highly effective at ensuring deep geographic penetration and managing the complex logistics of a nationwide cash distribution system.

#### **The Agent's Daily Reality**

Despite the maturity of the Kenyan market, mobile money agents face significant and persistent operational challenges that impact their efficiency and profitability.

**Liquidity Management:** This is universally cited as the most critical and vexing daily challenge for M-Pesa agents.8 Agents are in a constant struggle to balance their physical cash reserves (for customer withdrawals) with their electronic float (for customer deposits). An imbalance in either direction halts business; too little cash prevents withdrawals, while too little e-float prevents deposits. This problem is particularly acute on peak transaction days, such as government paydays.8 Research indicates that liquidity failures are common, with one study noting that 20% of M-Pesa customers have experienced an inability to withdraw money, with 70% of those failures attributed to the agent lacking sufficient funds.29 Rural agents are disproportionately affected by these logistical hurdles, taking an average of 42 minutes to rebalance their float compared to 26 minutes for their urban counterparts. This forces them to rely on informal and often less reliable methods, such as borrowing from other agents or using digital credit apps to secure funds.9

**Record-Keeping:** A significant gap exists between the digital nature of M-Pesa transactions and the predominantly manual methods agents use for business reconciliation. While Safaricom provides digital tools, their perceived unreliability forces agents to maintain parallel manual systems. User reviews of the official "M-Pesa for Business" application frequently cite issues with slow or non-posting of transactions in real-time. This forces agents to "keep manual books to close check" to ensure accuracy and reconcile their daily accounts.30 Safaricom's development of the M-Ledger app, which functions by scanning a user's SMS transaction notifications to build a financial ledger, is a tacit acknowledgment of this widespread need for better accounting tools. However, its method—relying on SMS scraping rather than direct system integration—highlights that it is a clever workaround, not a fundamental solution to the problem of unreliable, non-real-time data from the core platform.31

**Security & Fraud:** As handlers of significant cash and digital value, agents are prime targets for criminal activity. Fraud is a major operational risk, with theft being a more pronounced concern for rural agents (cited by 42%) compared to urban agents (29%).9 The agent's role as the trusted face of the M-Pesa brand means that maintaining agent quality and preventing agent-perpetrated fraud are critical for the health of the entire ecosystem.8

#### **The Existing Digital Toolkit**

Safaricom provides the "M-Pesa for Business" app, a dedicated tool for merchants and agents. Its primary functions are to track financial inflows and outflows, view transaction statements, and execute payments, such as paying suppliers or withdrawing funds to a bank account or another agent.30

However, user feedback reveals critical shortcomings that limit its effectiveness as a primary business management tool. The most significant complaint is the lack of real-time updates. Agents report that transactions are slow to post to the app's statement view, making it impossible to use for immediate, on-the-spot reconciliation.30 This "reliability gap" is the principal reason agents revert to manual ledgers. Furthermore, some users have criticized the app's reliance on a mobile data connection, noting that the data-free USSD channel (\*334\#) is often more convenient and reliable, especially in areas with poor internet connectivity.30 These gaps highlight a clear market opportunity for a solution that prioritizes real-time accuracy, reliability, and offline functionality.

#### **Regulatory & Compliance Environment**

The fintech and mobile money sector in Kenya is not governed by a single, bespoke legislative act. Instead, it is regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) through a framework of existing financial and communications laws.23 Key pieces of legislation include the National Payments Systems Act, which governs payment service providers (PSPs); the Central Bank of Kenya Act, which was amended to regulate digital credit providers; and the Data Protection Act of 2019, which mandates strict protocols for handling customer data.23

Of particular relevance is the CBK's Guideline on Agent Banking (CBK/PG/15), which lays out specific operational rules for agents.35 This guideline mandates that all transactions must be processed in real-time and that agents must issue a receipt (physical or electronic) for every transaction. It also contains stringent requirements for data confidentiality, stipulating that all customer data collected by an agent is the property of the financial institution and must be kept secure. These regulations create a compliance burden that a well-designed merchant app could help agents manage more effectively. Industry stakeholders have noted the complexity of this overlapping regulatory structure and have advocated for reforms such as a consolidated fintech sandbox and a dedicated national fintech policy to streamline compliance and foster innovation.37

#### **Viability Scorecard & Strategic Imperatives**

- **Viability:** High.
- **Rationale:** The Kenyan market is mature, with a digitally literate agent base that understands the value of efficiency. The agents face clear, well-documented, and unsolved operational problems, particularly around reconciliation and liquidity management. The documented reliability issues with Safaricom's own business application create a distinct and credible entry point for a competing product.
- **Strategic Imperative:** A new application entering this market cannot compete on brand or network size. Its sole path to success lies in offering demonstrably superior reliability, real-time accuracy, and a more intuitive user experience than the incumbent's offering. The go-to-market strategy must be carefully designed to function as an "over-the-top" service that complements the ubiquitous M-Pesa ecosystem, solving the business management problems that Safaricom has not prioritized.

### **3.2 Nigeria: The High-Growth Fintech Arena**

#### **Market & Operator Landscape**

Nigeria's mobile money ecosystem presents a stark contrast to the MNO-led model of East Africa. Here, the market is defined by the explosive growth of non-MNO, venture-backed fintech companies, with OPay and PalmPay emerging as the dominant players.13 These firms successfully capitalized on Nigeria's large population and high mobile phone penetration to build massive scale in a relatively short period.

Their rapid ascent was fueled by several key factors. First, an aggressive agent acquisition strategy led to the creation of vast distribution networks, with OPay boasting over 500,000 agents and PalmPay claiming over one million.15 Second, strategic partnerships provided a crucial competitive edge; PalmPay's relationship with mobile phone manufacturer Transsion allowed its app to be pre-installed on millions of Tecno, Infinix, and Itel devices, the dominant smartphone brands in Nigeria.15 Most critically, these fintechs benefited immensely from the systemic failures of traditional banks during the Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) chaotic naira redesign policy in late 2022 and early 2023\. As banking apps crashed and ATMs ran dry, millions of frustrated Nigerians turned to the more reliable and agile platforms offered by OPay and PalmPay, cementing their position in the market.15

#### **The Agent's Daily Reality**

The operational environment for Nigeria's Point of Sale (PoS) agents is characterized by immense opportunity but also significant challenges related to capital, record-keeping, and security.

**Liquidity Management:** As in other markets, maintaining sufficient operating capital, or "float," is a primary concern. Agents must have adequate cash on hand for withdrawals and sufficient digital funds in their wallets for deposits and transfers. Insufficient float is a leading cause of customer dissatisfaction and a common reason for new agent businesses to fail.40 The daily management of this float is a core operational task that directly impacts an agent's revenue-generating potential.

**Record-Keeping:** This is a major and widely acknowledged pain point. While CBN regulations mandate proper documentation of all transactions, the reality on the ground is that "Many PoS agents don’t track their income or expenses properly".40 The common recommendation for agents to use a "simple notebook or mobile app" for logging transactions confirms the widespread prevalence of manual record-keeping.40 This reliance on manual methods is inefficient, prone to error, and makes it difficult for agents to accurately assess their profitability, manage their business effectively, or comply with auditing requirements. Academic studies within Nigeria have shown a positive and significant relationship between effective record-keeping and business performance, underscoring the value that a proper digital solution could provide.41

**Security & Fraud:** Agents operate in a challenging environment marked by infrastructure deficits, including unreliable power and limited internet connectivity, which create inherent operational risks.42 They are also on the front lines of combating financial crime and face significant risks from cybersecurity threats and fraud.40 Agents are required by law to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and report any suspicious transactions to the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU).40 The regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent in this area; a recent CBN mandate requires all PoS terminals in the country to be geo-tagged with their precise GPS coordinates, a significant compliance undertaking aimed at curbing the use of fraudulent or "ghost" terminals.43

#### **The Existing Digital Toolkit**

The dominant fintech players provide their agents with digital tools to manage their businesses. OPay offers its merchants a "powerful dashboard to view all your business transactions," which provides "Business Intelligence and Growth Insights".44 This implies the availability of features for viewing transaction histories and some form of sales analytics.

Beyond the platforms of the major players, the broader Nigerian market features a variety of third-party PoS and business management software solutions, such as Nano POS and Kuda's softPOS, which can turn a smartphone into a payment terminal.45 These solutions often include more advanced features like general ledger accounting, inventory management, and detailed sales reporting. However, the continued and documented reliance of the mass market of PoS agents on manual notebooks suggests that these more sophisticated tools have not achieved widespread adoption at the grassroots level. This indicates a gap in the market for a solution that is specifically designed for the unique needs and operational context of a typical mobile money agent, prioritizing simplicity, reliability, and affordability over a complex feature set.

#### **Regulatory & Compliance Environment**

Nigeria's fintech sector is primarily regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), with additional oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for investment-related activities and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for services leveraging telecom infrastructure.16 The regulatory landscape is known for being both complex and dynamic, with frequent updates and new directives.

The CBN's 'Guidelines for the Regulation of Agent Banking and Agent Banking Relationships in Nigeria' provides the core framework for agent operations. It sets specific rules for record-keeping, mandating that settlement information be preserved for a minimum of five years.50 The guidelines are also strict on data confidentiality, stating that all customer data collected by an agent remains the property of the financial institution and must be kept confidential. Furthermore, they outline extensive consumer protection measures, including the mandatory issuance of receipts for all transactions and the establishment of clear dispute resolution mechanisms.50 The complexity of complying with these rules, along with newer regulations like the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and the PoS geo-tagging mandate, creates a significant administrative burden for agents—a burden that a purpose-built application could help to alleviate.

#### **Viability Scorecard & Strategic Imperatives**

- **Viability:** Very High.
- **Rationale:** The Nigerian market is enormous, continues to grow at a rapid pace, and is characterized by a large, fragmented, and highly competitive agent network. The clear evidence of operational inefficiencies, particularly the widespread reliance on manual record-keeping, presents a compelling opportunity for a digital solution. The dynamic and increasingly stringent regulatory environment also creates a strong value proposition for an app that can simplify compliance for agents.
- **Strategic Imperative:** The key to success in Nigeria will be an application that is extremely easy to use, highly reliable even in low-connectivity environments, and directly helps agents navigate their complex compliance obligations. Given the fragmented market, a go-to-market strategy centered on partnerships with agent network managers, super-agents, or financial institutions will be crucial for achieving scale quickly.

### **3.3 Tanzania: The Established Follower**

#### **Market & Operator Landscape**

Tanzania boasts a strong and well-established mobile money market that shares some characteristics with its Kenyan neighbor but features a more competitive landscape. Vodacom's M-Pesa is the market leader, holding a significant 40.4% of all mobile money accounts as of June 2025\.18 However, unlike in Kenya where M-Pesa's dominance is near-total, in Tanzania it faces robust competition from other major MNOs, primarily Tigo with its Tigo Pesa service and Airtel with Airtel Money.12 This competitive dynamic among multiple large players shapes the agent experience and the overall market structure. The market is mature, with mobile money having been present since 2008, and services have expanded beyond simple transfers to include microcredit, savings, and insurance products.18

#### **The Agent's Daily Reality**

Agents in Tanzania grapple with operational challenges that are consistent with those seen across the region, with liquidity and security being paramount concerns.

**Liquidity Management:** The "lack of financial capital" is cited as a primary problem for agents in Tanzania.19 This manifests as frequent cash balancing issues, where agents may lack sufficient e-float to accept cash deposits or enough physical cash to process withdrawals.19 The problem is particularly pronounced in rural areas, where facilitating larger transactions can be difficult. A contributing factor is that many individuals operate their mobile money agency as a secondary or tertiary business. This leads them to divert their limited working capital to other parts of their business based on daily demand, making their float levels for mobile money services less predictable and reliable.19

**Record-Keeping:** The available research does not provide explicit details on the specific record-keeping methods used by Tanzanian agents. However, studies have gathered data from "records completed by agents," which confirms that record-keeping is a standard operational practice.19 Given the challenges of managing a multi-faceted business and the persistent liquidity issues, the need for accurate and efficient financial tracking is implicit. The absence of prominent, dedicated agent business management apps from the major operators suggests that manual methods are likely prevalent, similar to other markets in the region.

**Security & Fraud:** Fraud is a significant and pervasive risk for both agents and consumers in Tanzania. Research has identified common fraud types including phishing (e.g., unauthorized SIM swaps), spoofing (e.g., fraudulent SMS messages), and social engineering via fake calls from individuals impersonating operator staff.52 A 2014 survey highlighted that Tanzania had a higher prevalence of certain types of agent-to-consumer fraud, such as overcharging for transactions (5% of respondents), compared to Kenya (2%).53 For agents, the primary fraud concerns involve the loss of float from their accounts through unauthorized access or scams, as well as risks from customers using fake currency for deposits.8

#### **The Existing Digital Toolkit**

The digital tools available in the Tanzanian market appear to be predominantly consumer-focused, with less emphasis on dedicated business management solutions for agents.

- **M-Pesa Tanzania App:** This is Vodacom's primary consumer application. Its features are geared towards the end-user, enabling them to send money (including cross-border), pay bills, and make merchant payments using QR codes. A notable feature is its ability to function offline for basic transactions by using SMS permissions, acknowledging the reality of intermittent data connectivity.54
- **Mixx Tanzania App:** This is the application for the Tigo Pesa service (now rebranded as Mixx by Yas). Similar to the M-Pesa app, it is a consumer wallet designed for sending money, accessing a variety of "mini-apps," and facilitating payments via QR codes.55

The notable absence of a widely marketed and adopted "M-Pesa for Business" equivalent in Tanzania suggests a significant gap in the market. Agents appear to be underserved by the current digital offerings, which are not tailored to their specific needs for reconciliation, profitability tracking, and liquidity management.

#### **Regulatory & Compliance Environment**

The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) is the primary regulator for the country's payment systems, operating under the authority of the National Payment Systems (NPS) Act of 2015\.56 The BoT has demonstrated a forward-looking approach to financial innovation by establishing a Fintech Regulatory Sandbox. This initiative is designed to allow innovative financial solutions to be tested in a live but controlled environment, providing a clear and supportive pathway for new market entrants to test their products and business models.20

A key aspect of the regulatory landscape is the government's use of transaction levies to increase its tax base. In recent years, levies have been imposed on mobile money transfers and withdrawals, which directly impacts the cost of services for consumers and affects the business models and commission structures for agents.57 Any new service entering the market must account for these levies in its pricing and value proposition.

#### **Viability Scorecard & Strategic Imperatives**

- **Viability:** High.
- **Rationale:** The Tanzanian market is large, mature, and competitive, with agents facing the same fundamental liquidity and fraud challenges seen elsewhere. The critical difference and key opportunity lie in the apparent lack of sophisticated, dedicated business management tools for agents from the incumbent MNOs. This creates a greenfield opportunity for a purpose-built solution.
- **Strategic Imperative:** The primary objective should be to introduce an application focused on core agent business management functions (liquidity tracking, reconciliation, expense management). The existence of the BoT's regulatory sandbox provides a strategic and potentially lower-risk pathway for market entry, allowing for product testing and regulatory engagement before a full-scale commercial launch.

### **3.4 Uganda: The Rising Star**

#### **Market & Operator Landscape**

Uganda has emerged as a dynamic and rapidly growing mobile money market, characterized by high digital adoption rates. In 2024, 71% of Ugandan adults reported using digital payment platforms, and the overall banked population reached 72.8%, indicating a strong foundation for digital financial services.4 The market structure is a competitive duopoly, dominated by the two largest MNOs: MTN, with its Mobile Money (MoMo) service, and Airtel, with Airtel Money.13 MTN, in particular, operates a vast agent network, with over 910,000 agents across all its operational markets, a significant portion of which are in Uganda.59 This established two-player market shapes the competitive dynamics and agent relationships.

#### **The Agent's Daily Reality**

The daily operations of a Ugandan mobile money agent are defined by the familiar challenges of managing liquidity and maintaining accurate records, with the dominant operators playing a direct role in both areas.

**Liquidity Management:** Float management is a recognized and significant operational hurdle for agents in Uganda. The issue is so prevalent that MTN has institutionalized a solution in the form of its "Xtra Float" service. This product allows agents to instantly borrow float directly through their phones via a USSD code, enabling them to continue serving customers when their own capital is low.60 The very existence and active promotion of such a service is direct evidence that agents frequently experience liquidity shortages that can disrupt their business continuity. This confirms that liquidity management is a core, unsolved pain point that impacts daily operations.

**Record-Keeping:** The practice of manual record-keeping is not just common in Uganda; it is an officially supported part of the agent operating model. MTN provides its agents with physical "transaction books" as part of their starter kit, institutionalizing the use of pen-and-paper ledgers for tracking transactions.60 This reliance on manual methods is further compounded by the shortcomings of existing digital tools. User reviews for the MoMo Merchant app reveal a critical flaw for business users: the inability to access transaction statements that are more than one month old.61 This severe limitation makes the app unsuitable for proper financial record-keeping, monthly reconciliation, or historical business analysis, forcing agents to depend on their manual transaction books as the primary system of record.

**Security & Fraud:** While specific fraud statistics for Uganda were not as detailed in the available material, a 2014 survey noted a particularly high incidence of agents overcharging customers, with 11% of users reporting this issue.53 This suggests potential challenges in transparency and accountability within the agent network. A robust, transparent, and accurate digital record-keeping system could help mitigate such issues by providing both the agent and the customer with a clear, indisputable record of every transaction and its associated fees.

#### **The Existing Digital Toolkit**

MTN offers a suite of applications for its various user segments, including dedicated apps for agents and merchants.

- **MoMo Agent Uganda App:** This application is specifically designed for agents to perform their core duties. It allows them to manage customer deposits and withdrawals, process bill payments, sell airtime, and transfer float between agents. It also includes basic account management features, such as viewing a mini-statement and checking commission earnings.62
- **MoMo Merchant App:** This is a separate application geared towards businesses that accept MoMo as a form of payment. It enables them to manage incoming and outgoing business payments (e.g., to suppliers or for salaries), sell airtime to generate additional revenue, and view a list of all transactions.61

Despite the availability of these dedicated apps, user reviews point to significant deficiencies. The general MoMo Agent app (across various markets) is frequently criticized for severe reliability problems, including persistent server connection errors and transaction failures that undermine its core purpose.65 As noted previously, the Merchant app's one-month limit on statement history is a critical failure for any serious business user, rendering it inadequate for proper accounting.61 These documented flaws create a clear and compelling opportunity for a third-party application that prioritizes reliability and robust record-keeping features.

#### **Regulatory & Compliance Environment**

Uganda's regulatory environment is generally viewed as progressive and conducive to fintech innovation. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) first issued mobile money guidelines in 2013 and has since maintained a regulatory approach that is considered flexible and supportive of the sector's growth.22 The ecosystem is also well-structured, with the Financial Technology Service Providers' Association (FITSPA) serving as an official umbrella body for fintech companies. This organized industry structure can facilitate dialogue with regulators and create a more predictable environment for new entrants.22

#### **Viability Scorecard & Strategic Imperatives**

- **Viability:** High.
- **Rationale:** The Ugandan market is well-developed, with high digital adoption and a clear duopolistic structure. The most compelling evidence for viability is the institutionalized use of manual "transaction books" and the documented, critical limitations of the incumbent MNOs' digital offerings, especially regarding record-keeping. This presents a strong, evidence-based case for a new solution.
- **Strategic Imperative:** The primary focus for a new application should be on delivering superior and reliable record-keeping functionality. Features such as an extended statement history, the ability to export reports, and automated profit and commission calculations would directly address the major shortcomings of existing tools. A successful product would position itself as the professional accounting and business management tool that agents need but are not receiving from the dominant operators.

## **Section 4: Cross-Market Synthesis: Universal Pain Points & Competitive Gaps**

### **4.1 The Three Pillars of Agent Pain**

The deep-dive analysis of Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda reveals that despite their unique market structures and regulatory landscapes, mobile money agents across the continent are united by a common set of fundamental operational challenges. These universal pain points can be synthesized into a framework of "Three Pillars" that define the agent's daily struggle for efficiency and profitability.

**Pillar 1: Liquidity & Float Management:** This is the most acute and immediate operational challenge. The constant, high-stakes balancing act of managing physical cash and electronic float is a daily preoccupation for agents in all four markets. It is a direct constraint on their ability to serve customers and generate revenue. A stock-out of either cash or e-float effectively shuts down the business until the agent can rebalance, a process that costs both time and money.8 The emergence of formal solutions like MTN's "Xtra Float" in Uganda and informal workarounds like agent-to-agent loans in Kenya underscores the severity and universality of this problem.9

**Pillar 2: Business & Financial Record-Keeping:** There is a profound disconnect between the high-tech nature of mobile money and the low-tech methods used to manage it at the agent level. The widespread and documented reliance on manual methods—such as physical notebooks in Nigeria and official "transaction books" in Uganda—is a major source of inefficiency, human error, and business risk.40 This practice is not born out of preference but out of necessity, driven by the perceived unreliability and functional limitations of the digital tools provided by operators. These manual systems make it exceedingly difficult for agents to accurately track their profitability, reconcile their accounts at the end of the day, manage expenses, or generate the financial records needed for formal credit applications.30

**Pillar 3: Security & Fraud Management:** Agents operate on the front lines of the financial system and are consequently exposed to a wide array of risks. These range from the physical threat of theft due to holding cash to sophisticated digital threats like phishing, spoofing, and account takeovers.9 In addition to these external threats, agents bear a significant compliance burden. They are responsible for implementing crucial anti-financial crime measures, such as performing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and adhering to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, which can be complex and time-consuming.40

### **4.2 Analysis of the Competitive Technology Landscape**

When the existing digital solutions offered by the dominant operators are assessed against these Three Pillars, a clear and consistent pattern of competitive gaps emerges. The incumbent applications are fundamentally designed for **transaction execution**, not **business management**. Their primary purpose is to facilitate deposits, withdrawals, and payments.32

The features intended to support business management are consistently found to be underdeveloped, unreliable, or functionally inadequate. For example, the business analytics and record-keeping tools that do exist are often basic and suffer from critical flaws, such as the slow posting of transactions in Kenya's M-Pesa for Business app or the severely limited one-month statement history in Uganda's MoMo Merchant app.30 This "reliability gap" is the single most important factor driving agents to maintain parallel manual systems. They simply cannot trust the operator-provided tools to be the definitive source of truth for their business finances.

Furthermore, there is a notable absence of integrated tools designed to help agents proactively manage the other two pillars. Solutions for liquidity, such as MTN's Xtra Float, are typically standalone services accessed via separate USSD channels, not integrated into a comprehensive management dashboard that could provide predictive insights or alerts.60 Similarly, there are no features explicitly designed to streamline the agent's compliance workflow, such as tools for digital KYC data capture or simplified reporting.

The following table provides a visual summary of this feature gap analysis, mapping the core needs of agents against the typical offerings of existing operator-provided applications.

| Agent Need (Categorized by Pillar)      | M-Pesa for Business (Kenya)      | MoMo Agent/Merchant (Uganda)               | OPay Merchant (Nigeria) |

| Compliance Reporting Aid                | No                               | No                                         | No                      |

This analysis clearly demonstrates that while operators have successfully built platforms for processing transactions, they have failed to provide their most critical partners—the agents—with the robust, reliable, and comprehensive tools needed to professionally manage their businesses. This represents the central strategic opportunity for a new market entrant.

## **Section 5: Strategic Recommendations for Market Entry & Product Launch**

### **5.1 Market Entry Prioritization & Phased Rollout**

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the four target markets, a phased market entry strategy is recommended to maximize the probability of success while managing risk and resource allocation effectively.

**Phase 1: Nigeria.** Nigeria should be the primary market for the initial launch. The rationale is compelling: it is the largest market by population, with a rapidly growing and highly dynamic mobile money sector. Crucially, the market is not dominated by a single MNO, but by several competing fintechs, creating a more fragmented and accessible ecosystem for a new entrant to establish partnerships.13 The proven demand for reliable third-party fintech solutions, as demonstrated by the mass migration from traditional banks, indicates a user base that is receptive to superior technology.15 Finally, the high and increasing compliance burden on agents, exemplified by the recent PoS geo-tagging mandate, creates a strong and immediate value proposition for an application that can simplify regulatory adherence.43

**Phase 2: Kenya.** Following a successful launch in Nigeria, Kenya should be the second market. As a mature and digitally savvy market, Kenyan agents possess a sophisticated understanding of the mobile money business and the value of efficiency-enhancing tools. The well-documented reliability gaps and functional limitations of Safaricom's "M-Pesa for Business" app create a specific and well-defined entry point for a product that can deliver a superior user experience.30 Achieving traction in the home of M-Pesa would serve as a powerful validation of the product's value proposition and a strong signal to the rest of the continent.

**Phase 3: Tanzania & Uganda.** These two markets represent ideal subsequent expansion targets. They are strong, growing markets that exhibit the same fundamental agent pain points identified in Nigeria and Kenya. The less-developed state of dedicated agent business management tools in Tanzania and the institutionalized reliance on manual "transaction books" in Uganda present clear and significant opportunities.19 The operational playbook, product features, and technological infrastructure developed and refined during the launches in Nigeria and Kenya can be effectively adapted and deployed in these markets.

### **5.2 Core Product Strategy: The Agent's Business-in-a-Box MVP**

The core product strategy must be laser-focused on solving the most acute and widespread agent pain points, positioning the application not as another payment tool, but as an indispensable business management platform. The central thesis is to address the "reliability gap" left by incumbent operators.

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) must be built around a **rock-solid, real-time, and offline-capable transaction ledger**. It must be demonstrably more reliable than both a manual notebook and the existing operator applications. The MVP feature set should directly address the Three Pillars of agent pain:

1. **Automated Digital Ledger:** The application's core function must be to automatically capture, categorize, and log all agent transactions (deposits, withdrawals, bill payments, airtime sales) in real-time. It must provide simple search and filtering capabilities, allowing an agent to instantly verify any transaction.
2. **Daily Business Dashboard:** This should be the application's home screen, providing an at-a-glance summary of the agent's business health. It should clearly display key metrics needed for daily reconciliation: closing e-float balance, closing cash-on-hand, total commissions earned, and, most importantly, the net profit for the day. This feature directly automates the tedious and error-prone manual reconciliation process.
3. **Smart Liquidity Alerts:** The application should include simple, user-configurable alerts that trigger when an agent's e-float balance drops below a certain threshold or their cash-on-hand exceeds a set limit. These proactive notifications would prompt the agent to rebalance their liquidity _before_ they are forced to turn away a customer, directly preventing lost revenue.
4. **Basic Expense Tracking:** A simple, intuitive interface should allow agents to quickly log their daily business expenses (e.g., rent, transport costs for float rebalancing, security). This data would feed into the profit calculation on the dashboard, giving the agent a true and accurate picture of their daily profitability for the first time.

### **5.3 Go-to-Market (GTM) Framework**

The significant structural differences between the target markets necessitate a bifurcated GTM strategy.

- **Nigeria (Partnership-Led Model):** Given the fragmented and competitive landscape, a direct-to-agent acquisition strategy would be slow and capital-intensive. The recommended approach is to pursue B2B partnerships with entities that already manage large networks of agents. This includes Super-Agents, Agent Network Managers, and Microfinance Banks. The application would be offered as a white-labeled or co-branded value-added service that these partners can provide to their downstream agents to improve their efficiency, profitability, and compliance.
- **Kenya/East Africa (Over-the-Top Model):** In the MNO-dominated markets of East Africa, a direct partnership with the dominant operator (e.g., Safaricom) will be challenging initially. The GTM strategy should therefore be an "Over-the-Top" (OTT) approach. In the short term, this may require leveraging technology like SMS-scraping (similar to Safaricom's own M-Ledger) to automatically populate the transaction ledger without needing a direct API integration.31 This would allow for the rapid acquisition of a user base. In parallel, the long-term goal should be to pursue formal API partnerships with the MNOs, positioning the application as a premium, third-party business management tool that enhances their ecosystem, increases agent loyalty, and reduces agent churn.

### **5.4 Regulatory Navigation Plan**

Navigating the complex regulatory environments of each market is critical for long-term success. The following steps are recommended:

1. **Engage Local Counsel:** Retain experienced local legal and regulatory counsel in each target market at the earliest stage of the market entry process.
2. **Nigeria:** The specific license required from the CBN will depend on the app's functionality. If it only aggregates and displays data without directly processing payments, it may fall under a technology provider category. If it facilitates payments, a license such as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) may be necessary. The application must be designed from the ground up to comply with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and assist agents in meeting their obligations under new directives like PoS geo-tagging.
3. **Kenya:** The application would likely need to be registered as a Payment Service Provider (PSP) with the CBK under the National Payments Systems Act. It must ensure full compliance with the CBK's Guideline on Agent Banking and the Data Protection Act, particularly concerning data confidentiality and real-time transaction reporting.
4. **Tanzania & Uganda:** The most prudent approach in these markets is to leverage the available regulatory sandboxes. Applying to the Bank of Tanzania's fintech sandbox or engaging with the Bank of Uganda through industry bodies like FITSPA would allow for product testing in a controlled environment, facilitating a collaborative relationship with regulators before a full-scale commercial launch.20

### **5.5 Future Outlook & Value-Added Services (Post-MVP)**

The initial MVP is designed to build trust and daily user engagement by solving the most fundamental operational problems. Once the application becomes an indispensable daily tool for a critical mass of agents, it can evolve into a powerful platform for delivering a range of higher-margin, data-driven financial services. This creates a long-term pathway to monetization beyond a simple subscription fee.

Future value-added services could include:

- **Integrated Float Loans:** By analyzing an agent's transaction history, cash flow, and profitability data, the application can generate a highly accurate, proprietary credit score. This data can be used to partner with financial institutions to offer instant, in-app float loans, with risk-based pricing and seamless repayment.
- **Micro-Insurance:** Offer tailored insurance products designed for the specific risks agents face, such as theft of cash or devices, or business interruption insurance.
- **Inventory Management:** For the large number of agents who run a retail shop as their primary business, the application can be expanded to include simple inventory tracking and sales management features, creating a single, unified platform for their entire business.
- **Supplier Payments & B2B Marketplace:** Evolve the platform to allow agents to pay their own suppliers directly from the app and eventually integrate a B2B marketplace where they can order stock and supplies, transforming the app from a simple management tool into a comprehensive commerce platform.
