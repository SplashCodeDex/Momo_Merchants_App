### Historical Decisions
Major architectural and strategic decisions with their rationale.

#### Technology Stack Selection (September 2025)
**Decision**: React Native + Node.js + PostgreSQL + AWS
**Rationale**: Single codebase, strong ecosystem, ACID compliance
**Outcome**: Successful implementation, good developer experience
**Review**: [Technology Stack Retrospective](technology-stack-retrospective.md)

#### Offline-First Architecture (September 2025)
**Decision**: Comprehensive offline support with SQLite + sync
**Rationale**: Critical for target market with unreliable connectivity
**Outcome**: 99.9% sync success rate in testing
**Review**: [Offline Architecture Review](offline-architecture-review.md)

#### Security Framework (September 2025)
**Decision**: Multi-layer security with biometric authentication
**Rationale**: Financial data requires bank-grade security
**Outcome**: Compliant with regulatory requirements
**Review**: [Security Implementation Review](security-implementation-review.md)

## Archive Management

### Archival Process
1. **Completion Verification**: Ensure all deliverables are met
2. **Documentation Review**: Update all relevant documentation
3. **Lessons Learned**: Capture insights and improvements
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Document for future reference
5. **Archival**: Move to Archives directory with proper categorization

### Archive Organization
- **By Project**: Group related artifacts together
- **By Date**: Chronological organization for historical context
- **By Type**: Separate folders for decisions, resources, features
- **Searchable**: Include metadata and cross-references

### Retention Policy
- **Active Projects**: Keep in Projects until completion
- **Completed Work**: Retain indefinitely for reference
- **Deprecated Code**: Archive with migration documentation
- **Historical Data**: Preserve for compliance and analysis

### Access and Search
- **Index Files**: Comprehensive indexes for each category
- **Cross-References**: Links between related archived items
- **Search Tags**: Metadata tags for improved discoverability
- **Version History**: Git history preserved for all changes
