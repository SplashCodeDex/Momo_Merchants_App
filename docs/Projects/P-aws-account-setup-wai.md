# Write-Ahead Intent: AWS Account Setup

## üéØ Intent
Establish a secure, scalable AWS cloud infrastructure foundation for the MoMo Merchant Companion App that supports development, staging, and production environments with proper access controls and cost management.

## üìã Rationale
Cloud infrastructure is critical for modern application development, providing scalability, reliability, and global reach. Proper AWS setup ensures security, cost efficiency, and operational excellence from day one, preventing technical debt and enabling rapid feature development.

## üéØ Expected Outcome
- ‚úÖ **AWS Account**: Production-ready account with proper billing and support
- ‚úÖ **IAM Foundation**: Secure user management and access controls
- ‚úÖ **Cost Management**: Budgets, alerts, and cost optimization
- ‚úÖ **Security Baseline**: MFA, password policies, and access monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Environment**: Separate dev, staging, and production configurations
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD Integration**: Automated deployment capabilities

## üîç Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Single AWS Account
- **Pros**: Simple management, unified billing
- **Cons**: Security risks, no environment isolation
- **Decision**: Rejected - Too risky for production workloads

### Option 2: Multiple Independent Accounts
- **Pros**: Complete isolation, granular security
- **Cons**: Complex management, higher costs, difficult cross-account access
- **Decision**: Considered but AWS Organizations provides better balance

### Option 3: Other Cloud Providers
- **Pros**: Alternative ecosystems, potentially lower costs
- **Cons**: Limited African presence, less fintech integration
- **Decision**: AWS chosen for global infrastructure and service ecosystem

## üìù Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Account Provisioning
1. **AWS Account Creation**: Set up root account with proper contact information
2. **Billing Configuration**: Enable consolidated billing and cost allocation tags
3. **Support Plan**: Select appropriate AWS support tier
4. **Root Account Security**: Enable MFA and secure credentials
5. **Account Aliases**: Configure user-friendly account identifiers

### Phase 2: AWS Organizations Setup
1. **Organization Creation**: Establish organizational structure
2. **Organizational Units**: Create OUs for dev, staging, production
3. **Service Control Policies**: Implement security guardrails
4. **Member Accounts**: Create separate accounts for each environment
5. **Cross-Account Access**: Configure IAM roles for cross-account operations

### Phase 3: IAM Foundation
1. **Identity Center**: Set up AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly SSO)
2. **User Groups**: Create groups for developers, admins, read-only users
3. **Permission Sets**: Define least-privilege access policies
4. **MFA Enforcement**: Require multi-factor authentication for all users
5. **Access Keys**: Configure programmatic access with rotation policies

### Phase 4: Security & Compliance
1. **CloudTrail**: Enable comprehensive audit logging
2. **Config Rules**: Set up automated compliance monitoring
3. **GuardDuty**: Enable threat detection and monitoring
4. **Security Hub**: Centralized security findings and alerts
5. **Compliance Frameworks**: Configure for relevant standards (SOC 2, etc.)

### Phase 5: Cost Management
1. **Budgets**: Set up cost budgets with alerts
2. **Cost Allocation Tags**: Implement resource tagging strategy
3. **Savings Plans**: Configure for EC2 and Fargate usage
4. **Cost Explorer**: Enable detailed cost analysis
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Set up unusual spending alerts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Security Misconfiguration
- **Mitigation**: Use AWS Config rules and automated remediation
- **Contingency**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Risk: Cost Overruns
- **Mitigation**: Budget alerts and resource tagging policies
- **Contingency**: Cost optimization tools and reserved instances

### Risk: Account Compromise
- **Mitigation**: MFA, least privilege, and monitoring
- **Contingency**: Incident response plan and backup access methods

## üìä Success Criteria
- [ ] AWS account fully configured with proper security
- [ ] IAM users and roles set up with least privilege
- [ ] Cost monitoring and budgets active
- [ ] Multi-environment structure established
- [ ] CI/CD integration ready for deployments

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline
- **Week 1**: Account provisioning and basic setup
- **Week 2**: Organizations, IAM, and security configuration
- **Week 3**: Cost management and monitoring setup
- **Week 4**: Testing and documentation

## üìö Dependencies
- Phase 0.11: Terraform Foundation (parallel development)
- Phase 0.12: Remote State Configuration (parallel development)
