# Write-Ahead Intent: Phase 2 - Offline Transaction Management

## Intent
Implement a robust offline-first transaction management system that enables full functionality without network connectivity, ensuring seamless data synchronization and conflict resolution for the MoMo Merchant Companion App.

## Rationale
Mobile money agents in Sub-Saharan Africa often operate in areas with unreliable network connectivity. The app must provide full functionality offline while ensuring data integrity and synchronization when connectivity is restored. This offline-first architecture is critical for user adoption and operational reliability in the target markets.

## Expected Outcome
- Complete offline transaction management system with local database
- Seamless synchronization with conflict resolution
- Real-time balance updates and transaction tracking
- Comprehensive offline error handling and user feedback
- Data persistence across app restarts and device changes
- 99.9% sync success rate with sub-500ms local query performance

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Online-Only Architecture**: Rejected due to unreliable network conditions in target markets
2. **Firebase Offline**: Considered but rejected due to vendor lock-in and cost concerns
3. **Custom SQLite Solution**: Evaluated but WatermelonDB provides better React integration
4. **No Encryption**: Rejected due to security requirements for financial data
5. **Simple Sync**: Considered but complex conflict resolution needed for financial data

## Implementation Approach
1. **Local Database**: WatermelonDB with SQLCipher encryption for secure local storage
2. **Schema Design**: Transaction schema with sync metadata and conflict resolution fields
3. **CRUD Operations**: Full transaction lifecycle management with optimistic updates
4. **Offline Queue**: Persistent queue for pending operations with retry logic
5. **Sync Engine**: Batch processing with exponential backoff and conflict resolution
6. **Network Detection**: Real-time connectivity monitoring with adaptive behavior
7. **Background Sync**: Platform-specific background sync capabilities
8. **Real-time Updates**: Observable patterns for balance and transaction updates
9. **UI Components**: Transaction forms and lists with offline indicators
10. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and recovery mechanisms

## Dependencies
- WatermelonDB and SQLCipher for local database
- React Hook Form and Zod for form validation
- NetInfo for network connectivity detection
- React Native Background Fetch/WorkManager for background sync
- React Query for server state management
- React Native MMKV for encrypted local storage

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Database operations, sync logic, conflict resolution
- **Integration Tests**: Full offline-to-online workflow testing
- **E2E Tests**: Complete transaction lifecycle in offline scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Local query performance and sync efficiency
- **Device Tests**: Cross-device compatibility and data persistence
- **Network Tests**: Various connectivity scenarios and edge cases

## Performance Impact
- **Local Queries**: <100ms response time for transaction queries
- **Sync Performance**: <500ms for typical sync operations
- **Storage**: <50MB for 10,000 transactions with encryption
- **Memory**: <100MB additional memory usage for offline functionality
- **Battery**: <5% battery impact from background sync operations

## Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: SQLCipher encryption for local database
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage using platform keychains
- **Data Sanitization**: Sensitive data removal from logs and crash reports
- **Sync Security**: End-to-end encryption for data in transit
- **Offline Security**: Biometric authentication for offline access
- **Audit Trail**: Local audit logging for offline operations

## Rollback Plan
- **Database Rollback**: Schema migration rollback procedures
- **Data Recovery**: Backup and restore mechanisms for local data
- **Sync Reset**: Force full resync from server if corruption detected
- **Feature Flags**: Ability to disable offline features if issues arise
- **User Data Export**: Manual export functionality for data recovery

## Success Metrics
- **Offline Functionality**: 100% of core features work without network
- **Sync Success Rate**: >99.9% successful synchronization
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss during sync operations
- **User Experience**: Seamless transition between online/offline states
- **Performance**: <500ms local query response time
- **Conflict Resolution**: <5% of syncs require manual conflict resolution

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Local database setup and schema design
- **Week 2**: CRUD operations and form validation
- **Week 3**: Offline queue and basic sync engine
- **Week 4**: Conflict resolution and network detection
- **Week 5**: Background sync and real-time updates
- **Week 6**: UI components, error handling, and testing

## Documentation Updates
- **Architecture Documentation**: Offline-first architecture patterns
- **API Documentation**: Sync protocol and conflict resolution
- **User Documentation**: Offline functionality and troubleshooting
- **Developer Documentation**: Local database setup and sync implementation
- **Testing Documentation**: Offline testing scenarios and procedures
