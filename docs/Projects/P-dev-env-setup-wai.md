# Write-Ahead Intent: Development Environment Setup

## üéØ Intent
Establish a consistent, reproducible development environment for the MoMo Merchant Companion App that enables efficient development across the team while maintaining code quality and security standards.

## üìã Rationale
A standardized development environment is critical for team productivity, code consistency, and preventing "works on my machine" issues. This setup must support both React Native mobile development and Node.js backend development within the monorepo structure.

## üéØ Expected Outcome
- ‚úÖ **Node.js Environment**: Consistent Node.js version and package management
- ‚úÖ **React Native Setup**: iOS and Android development environments configured
- ‚úÖ **Development Tools**: Linting, formatting, and testing tools ready
- ‚úÖ **Monorepo Workflow**: Turborepo and workspace management functional
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Pre-commit hooks and code quality gates active
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Setup instructions and troubleshooting guides

## üîç Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Individual Developer Setup
- **Pros**: Developer choice, potentially optimized for individual preferences
- **Cons**: Inconsistency, setup time, debugging complexity, "works on my machine" issues
- **Decision**: Rejected - Need consistency for team collaboration

### Option 2: Docker-Only Development
- **Pros**: Perfect consistency, easy onboarding, environment isolation
- **Cons**: Performance overhead, complex debugging, limited native mobile testing
- **Decision**: Considered but deferred - Start with local setup, add Docker later

### Option 3: Cloud Development Environment (GitHub Codespaces)
- **Pros**: Zero local setup, consistent environment, easy sharing
- **Cons**: Cost, internet dependency, limited mobile development capabilities
- **Decision**: Considered for future - Start with local setup for better mobile dev

## üìù Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Node.js and Package Management
1. **Node Version Manager**: Install and configure nvm for consistent Node.js versions
2. **Package Managers**: Set up npm and yarn with workspace support
3. **Global Tools**: Install essential development tools (TypeScript, ESLint, etc.)
4. **Monorepo Tools**: Configure Turborepo for efficient builds and caching

### Phase 2: React Native Development Environment
1. **iOS Development**:
   - Install Xcode and iOS Simulator
   - Configure CocoaPods for iOS dependencies
   - Set up iOS certificates and provisioning profiles (for testing)
2. **Android Development**:
   - Install Android Studio and SDK
   - Configure Android Virtual Device (AVD)
   - Set up Android SDK environment variables
3. **React Native CLI**: Install and configure React Native CLI tools

### Phase 3: Development Tools and Quality Gates
1. **Code Quality**: Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript
2. **Testing Framework**: Set up Jest and React Native Testing Library
3. **Git Hooks**: Configure Husky for pre-commit quality checks
4. **VS Code**: Set up recommended extensions and settings

### Phase 4: Backend Development Environment
1. **Database Tools**: Install PostgreSQL client tools
2. **API Testing**: Set up tools for testing REST APIs
3. **Environment Variables**: Configure development environment files
4. **Local Services**: Set up local development databases if needed

### Phase 5: Documentation and Onboarding
1. **Setup Guide**: Create comprehensive setup instructions
2. **Troubleshooting**: Document common issues and solutions
3. **Best Practices**: Establish development workflow guidelines
4. **Team Onboarding**: Create checklist for new team members

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Platform-Specific Issues
- **Mitigation**: Document platform-specific requirements and provide setup scripts
- **Contingency**: Create platform-specific setup guides and support channels

### Risk: Version Conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Pin exact versions in package.json and document version requirements
- **Contingency**: Regular dependency updates and version conflict resolution guides

### Risk: Performance Issues
- **Mitigation**: Configure development tools for optimal performance (Turborepo caching)
- **Contingency**: Performance monitoring and optimization guidelines

## üìä Success Criteria
- [ ] Node.js environment consistently set up across team
- [ ] React Native development possible on both iOS and Android
- [ ] All linting and formatting tools working correctly
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks preventing low-quality commits
- [ ] Development workflow documented and accessible
- [ ] New team members can set up environment independently

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline
- **Week 1**: Node.js and package management setup
- **Week 2**: React Native development environment
- **Week 3**: Development tools and quality gates
- **Week 4**: Documentation and testing
