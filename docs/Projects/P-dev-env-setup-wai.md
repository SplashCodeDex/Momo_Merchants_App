# Write-Ahead Intent: Development Environment Setup

## üéØ Intent
Establish a comprehensive, cross-platform development environment that enables seamless collaboration and consistent development experiences across all team members for the MoMo Merchant Companion App.

## üìã Rationale
A standardized development environment is crucial for modern software development, ensuring that all team members can work efficiently without environment-specific issues. This eliminates the "works on my machine" problem and accelerates onboarding of new developers.

## üéØ Expected Outcome
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Setup**: Consistent environment on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- ‚úÖ **Automated Installation**: One-command setup for all development tools
- ‚úÖ **Container Support**: Docker-based development for complex dependencies
- ‚úÖ **IDE Integration**: VS Code configuration with extensions and settings
- ‚úÖ **Testing Environment**: Local testing capabilities for all components
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup guides and troubleshooting

## üîç Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Manual Setup Documentation
- **Pros**: Simple to create, no additional tooling
- **Cons**: Error-prone, time-consuming, inconsistent results
- **Decision**: Rejected - Too unreliable for team productivity

### Option 2: Vagrant Virtual Machines
- **Pros**: Consistent environments, isolated from host
- **Cons**: Resource intensive, slow startup, complex networking
- **Decision**: Considered but Docker provides better balance

### Option 3: GitHub Codespaces
- **Pros**: Zero local setup, consistent cloud environment
- **Cons**: Requires internet, additional cost, limited customization
- **Decision**: Good for remote work but local development preferred

## üìù Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Development Tools
1. **Node.js Setup**: Version management with nvm or volta
2. **React Native CLI**: Android Studio, Xcode, and platform tools
3. **Package Managers**: npm, yarn, and pnpm configuration
4. **Git Configuration**: Hooks, aliases, and credential management
5. **Shell Environment**: Zsh/Bash configuration with useful aliases

### Phase 2: Development Scripts
1. **Setup Automation**: One-command environment setup
2. **Health Checks**: Automated environment validation
3. **Dependency Management**: Automated package installation
4. **Database Setup**: Local PostgreSQL and Redis
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Local test environment setup

### Phase 3: IDE and Tooling
1. **VS Code Configuration**: Extensions, settings, and workspace
2. **Docker Integration**: Development containers and compose
3. **API Testing**: Postman/Insomnia collections and environments
4. **Database Tools**: pgAdmin, RedisInsight, and MongoDB Compass
5. **Monitoring Tools**: Local logging and metrics setup

### Phase 4: Documentation and Support
1. **Setup Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for each platform
2. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
3. **Best Practices**: Development workflow guidelines
4. **Team Onboarding**: New developer setup process
5. **Environment Updates**: Keeping environments current

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Platform-Specific Issues
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing on all platforms, fallback options
- **Contingency**: Docker-based development as universal fallback

### Risk: Tool Version Conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Version pinning and automated updates
- **Contingency**: Version management tools and rollback procedures

### Risk: Security Vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Regular security audits and dependency updates
- **Contingency**: Automated vulnerability scanning and alerts

## üìä Success Criteria
- [ ] All team members can set up environment in < 30 minutes
- [ ] Consistent development experience across platforms
- [ ] Automated testing works locally for all components
- [ ] New developers can be productive within 1 day
- [ ] Environment issues resolved within 1 hour
- [ ] Documentation kept current with tool updates

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline
- **Week 1**: Core tools and automation scripts
- **Week 2**: Platform-specific configurations and testing
- **Week 3**: Documentation and team training
- **Week 4**: Monitoring and continuous improvement

## üìö Dependencies
- Phase 0.2: Monorepo Configuration (workspace structure)
- Phase 0.3: TypeScript Configuration (language setup)
- Phase 0.4: Linting & Formatting (code quality tools)
