# Write-Ahead Intent: Terraform Foundation

## üéØ Intent
Establish a comprehensive Infrastructure as Code foundation using Terraform to create reusable, secure, and scalable cloud infrastructure modules for the MoMo Merchant Companion App.

## üìã Rationale
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is essential for modern cloud applications, providing consistency, repeatability, and version control for infrastructure changes. Terraform enables multi-cloud deployments, state management, and collaborative infrastructure development.

## üéØ Expected Outcome
- ‚úÖ **Modular Architecture**: Reusable Terraform modules for VPC, security, and IAM
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Environment**: Separate configurations for dev, staging, and production
- ‚úÖ **Security First**: Infrastructure with security best practices built-in
- ‚úÖ **Cost Optimized**: Resource configurations optimized for cost efficiency
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD Ready**: Infrastructure that integrates with automated deployment pipelines
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring Enabled**: Infrastructure with logging and monitoring configured

## üîç Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: CloudFormation Only
- **Pros**: Native AWS integration, no additional tooling
- **Cons**: AWS-only, steeper learning curve, less flexible
- **Decision**: Rejected - Multi-cloud potential and Terraform ecosystem

### Option 2: Manual Infrastructure
- **Pros**: Quick initial setup, full control
- **Cons**: Not repeatable, error-prone, difficult to track changes
- **Decision**: Rejected - Doesn't scale and violates IaC principles

### Option 3: Pulumi (Code as Infrastructure)
- **Pros**: Familiar programming languages, type safety
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, additional complexity
- **Decision**: Considered but Terraform chosen for maturity and adoption

## üìù Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Terraform Setup and Configuration
1. **Directory Structure**: Create organized module and environment directories
2. **Provider Configuration**: Set up AWS provider with proper authentication
3. **Backend Configuration**: Configure S3 backend for remote state
4. **Variable Management**: Define reusable variables and locals
5. **Output Management**: Structure outputs for cross-module communication

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Modules
1. **VPC Module**: Multi-AZ VPC with public/private subnets
2. **Security Module**: Security groups, NACLs, and WAF rules
3. **IAM Module**: Roles, policies, and instance profiles
4. **Networking Module**: Route tables, internet gateways, NAT gateways
5. **Storage Module**: S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, EFS

### Phase 3: Application-Specific Modules
1. **Database Module**: RDS PostgreSQL with high availability
2. **Compute Module**: ECS Fargate for containerized applications
3. **Load Balancer Module**: ALB/NLB with SSL termination
4. **CDN Module**: CloudFront distributions with WAF
5. **Monitoring Module**: CloudWatch, X-Ray, and alerting

### Phase 4: Environment Configuration
1. **Development Environment**: Minimal resources for development
2. **Staging Environment**: Production-like setup for testing
3. **Production Environment**: Full HA setup with redundancy
4. **DR Environment**: Backup region for disaster recovery

### Phase 5: Security and Compliance
1. **Encryption**: KMS keys for data encryption
2. **Access Control**: Least privilege IAM policies
3. **Network Security**: VPC endpoints and security groups
4. **Compliance**: Config rules and security best practices
5. **Audit Trail**: CloudTrail integration and log aggregation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: State File Corruption
- **Mitigation**: S3 backend with DynamoDB locking, regular backups
- **Contingency**: State file recovery procedures and version control

### Risk: Resource Conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Proper resource naming, tagging, and dependency management
- **Contingency**: Terraform state inspection and manual conflict resolution

### Risk: Cost Overruns
- **Mitigation**: Resource tagging, cost allocation, and budget alerts
- **Contingency**: Resource cleanup scripts and cost monitoring

## üìä Success Criteria
- [ ] Terraform modules functional and reusable
- [ ] Multi-environment configurations working
- [ ] Security best practices implemented
- [ ] CI/CD integration successful
- [ ] Cost optimization applied
- [ ] Documentation complete

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline
- **Week 1**: Terraform setup and core modules
- **Week 2**: Application modules and environment configs
- **Week 3**: Security implementation and testing
- **Week 4**: CI/CD integration and documentation

## üìö Dependencies
- Phase 0.10: AWS Account Setup (S3 buckets, DynamoDB table)
- Phase 0.12: Remote State Configuration (parallel development)
