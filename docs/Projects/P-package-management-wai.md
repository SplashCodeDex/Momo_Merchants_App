# Write-Ahead Intent: Package Management Setup

## 🎯 Intent
Establish a robust, scalable package management system for the MoMo Merchant Companion App monorepo that ensures dependency consistency, security, and efficient development workflows across all workspaces.

## 📋 Rationale
Effective package management is critical for monorepo success, ensuring that dependencies are managed consistently, security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly, and development workflows remain efficient as the codebase grows.

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
- ✅ **Workspace Management**: Efficient npm workspace configuration
- ✅ **Dependency Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning and updates
- ✅ **Version Consistency**: Unified versioning strategy across workspaces
- ✅ **Publishing Pipeline**: Automated package publishing and distribution
- ✅ **Development Efficiency**: Fast installs and reliable caching

## 🔍 Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Individual Package Management
- **Pros**: Simple, independent versioning
- **Cons**: Dependency conflicts, maintenance overhead
- **Decision**: Rejected - Doesn't scale with monorepo complexity

### Option 2: Yarn Workspaces Only
- **Pros**: Better performance, reliable installs
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, fewer tools
- **Decision**: Considered but npm workspaces chosen for broader adoption

### Option 3: Lerna for Everything
- **Pros**: Powerful monorepo management
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, learning curve
- **Decision**: Turborepo provides better DX for our use case

## 📝 Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Workspace Configuration
1. **npm Workspaces**: Configure root-level workspace management
2. **Dependency Hoisting**: Optimize package installation and storage
3. **Workspace Scripts**: Create cross-workspace command execution
4. **Lockfile Management**: Ensure consistent dependency resolution

### Phase 2: Dependency Management
1. **Security Scanning**: Implement automated vulnerability detection
2. **Update Automation**: Set up dependency update workflows
3. **License Compliance**: Track and manage package licenses
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Monitor package bundle sizes and dependencies

### Phase 3: Publishing Infrastructure
1. **Version Strategy**: Implement unified versioning across workspaces
2. **Publishing Scripts**: Create automated publishing workflows
3. **Registry Configuration**: Set up package registries and authentication
4. **Distribution Management**: Configure CDN and caching strategies

### Phase 4: Development Tools
1. **Caching Optimization**: Implement intelligent caching strategies
2. **Local Development**: Set up local package linking and testing
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate package management with pipelines
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create package health and usage metrics

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Dependency Conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Strict versioning policies and regular conflict resolution
- **Contingency**: Dependency isolation and gradual migration strategies

### Risk: Security Vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Automated scanning and immediate patching workflows
- **Contingency**: Security incident response plan and backup registries

### Risk: Publishing Failures
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and rollback capabilities
- **Contingency**: Manual publishing procedures and version recovery

## 📊 Success Criteria
- [ ] All workspaces install in < 2 minutes
- [ ] Zero dependency conflicts in CI/CD
- [ ] All security vulnerabilities patched within 24 hours
- [ ] Package publishing successful 100% of the time
- [ ] Development workflows optimized for speed

## ⏱️ Timeline
- **Week 1**: Workspace configuration and basic management
- **Week 2**: Security scanning and dependency updates
- **Week 3**: Publishing infrastructure and automation
- **Week 4**: Monitoring, optimization, and documentation

## 📚 Dependencies
- Phase 0.2: Monorepo Configuration (workspace structure)
- Phase 0.6: CI/CD Pipeline (automation foundation)
- Phase 0.7: Governance Documents (policies and procedures)
