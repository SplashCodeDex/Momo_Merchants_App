# Write-Ahead Intent: Package Management Setup

## 🎯 Intent
Establish a robust, scalable package management system for the MoMo Merchant Companion App monorepo that ensures consistent dependencies, efficient builds, and reliable deployments across all workspaces.

## 📋 Rationale
Effective package management is critical for monorepo success. Without proper dependency management, teams face version conflicts, inconsistent builds, and deployment failures. This setup must support the complex requirements of React Native, Node.js, and shared packages while maintaining development efficiency.

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
- ✅ **Workspace Management**: Efficient npm workspaces with proper dependency resolution
- ✅ **Dependency Strategy**: Clear policies for internal vs external dependencies
- ✅ **Build Optimization**: Turborepo caching and parallel builds
- ✅ **Version Management**: Consistent versioning across packages
- ✅ **Publishing Pipeline**: Automated package publishing and distribution
- ✅ **Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning and updates

## 🔍 Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Individual Package Management
- **Pros**: Simple, familiar npm/yarn commands per package
- **Cons**: Version drift, inconsistent builds, manual coordination
- **Decision**: Rejected - Too error-prone for monorepo scale

### Option 2: Lerna + Yarn Workspaces
- **Pros**: Mature tooling, good community support
- **Cons**: Slower than Turborepo, more complex configuration
- **Decision**: Considered but Turborepo offers better performance

### Option 3: Nx Monorepo
- **Pros**: Excellent tooling, code generation, plugin ecosystem
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, potentially overkill for current needs
- **Decision**: Deferred - Start with Turborepo, migrate if needed

## 📝 Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Workspace Configuration
1. **npm Workspaces Setup**: Configure root package.json with workspace definitions
2. **Dependency Categorization**: Classify dependencies (internal, external, dev, peer)
3. **Workspace Protocols**: Define rules for cross-workspace dependencies
4. **Build Dependencies**: Establish workspace build order and dependencies

### Phase 2: Turborepo Optimization
1. **Pipeline Configuration**: Set up build pipelines with caching
2. **Task Dependencies**: Define task relationships and parallelization
3. **Remote Caching**: Configure Turborepo remote cache for team efficiency
4. **Build Optimization**: Implement selective builds and affected package detection

### Phase 3: Dependency Management
1. **Version Pinning**: Strategy for dependency version management
2. **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection and updates
3. **License Compliance**: Dependency license checking and reporting
4. **Update Automation**: Scheduled dependency updates with testing

### Phase 4: Publishing Infrastructure
1. **Package Registry**: Configure npm registry for private packages
2. **Version Strategy**: Semantic versioning with automated releases
3. **Publishing Pipeline**: CI/CD integration for package publishing
4. **Distribution**: CDN and caching for package distribution

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Usage Analytics**: Track package usage and performance metrics
2. **Health Monitoring**: Automated checks for package health
3. **Maintenance Automation**: Automated cleanup and optimization
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive package management documentation

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Dependency Conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Strict version pinning and conflict resolution policies
- **Contingency**: Automated conflict detection and resolution workflows

### Risk: Build Performance Degradation
- **Mitigation**: Turborepo caching and selective builds
- **Contingency**: Performance monitoring and optimization strategies

### Risk: Publishing Failures
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing before publishing
- **Contingency**: Rollback procedures and version management

## 📊 Success Criteria
- [ ] All workspaces properly configured and functional
- [ ] Turborepo caching reduces build times by 70%
- [ ] Zero dependency conflicts in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Automated publishing working reliably
- [ ] Security scanning integrated into development workflow
- [ ] Team can efficiently manage package dependencies
