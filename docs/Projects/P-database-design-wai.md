# Write-Ahead Intent: Database Design with PostgreSQL and UUID v7

## Intent
Design and implement a robust PostgreSQL database schema with UUID v7 for the MoMo Merchant Companion App, ensuring optimal performance, data integrity, and compliance requirements.

## Rationale
The database is the foundation of the application, storing all transaction data, user information, and business logic. Using PostgreSQL provides enterprise-grade reliability, and UUID v7 offers better indexing performance compared to random UUIDs while maintaining uniqueness. This design must support offline-first architecture, audit logging, and regulatory compliance.

## Expected Outcome
- Complete PostgreSQL schema with all required tables and relationships
- Optimized indexes for query performance
- UUID v7 implementation for all primary keys
- Audit logging tables for compliance
- Database documentation and ER diagrams
- Migration scripts for schema deployment

## Alternatives Considered
1. **MongoDB**: Considered for flexibility, but PostgreSQL provides better ACID compliance and relational integrity needed for financial data
2. **UUID v4**: Random UUIDs cause index fragmentation; UUID v7 provides better clustering
3. **Auto-increment IDs**: Not suitable for distributed systems and offline-first architecture
4. **MySQL**: Lacks some PostgreSQL features like advanced JSON support and better concurrency

## Implementation Approach
1. Design core entities: Users, Transactions, Merchants, Audit Logs
2. Implement UUID v7 generation using PostgreSQL functions
3. Create optimized indexes and constraints
4. Set up audit triggers for compliance
5. Design data partitioning strategy for large transaction volumes
6. Create database documentation and migration scripts

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL 15+ server
- Database migration tools (Prisma/Flyway)
- AWS RDS or equivalent cloud database service
- Database administration tools

## Testing Strategy
- Schema validation tests
- Performance benchmarks for key queries
- Concurrency testing for transaction handling
- Data integrity validation
- Migration testing on staging environment

## Performance Impact
- Expected: Improved query performance with UUID v7 clustering
- Expected: Reduced index fragmentation compared to UUID v4
- Expected: Better support for time-based queries
- Risk: Slightly larger storage footprint due to UUIDs vs integers

## Security Considerations
- Row-level security for multi-tenant data
- Encryption at rest for sensitive financial data
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- Access controls and permission management
- Data retention policies for compliance

## Rollback Plan
- Database backups before migration
- Rollback scripts for schema changes
- Data migration reversal procedures
- Fallback to previous schema version if needed

## Success Metrics
- Schema supports all required entities and relationships
- Query performance meets <500ms target for key operations
- UUID v7 implementation working correctly
- Audit logging captures all required events
- Migration scripts execute successfully

## Timeline
- Week 1: Schema design and documentation
- Week 2: Implementation and optimization
- Week 3: Testing and validation
- Week 4: Migration script creation

## Documentation Updates
- Database schema documentation
- ER diagrams and relationship maps
- Index and performance optimization guide
- Migration and deployment procedures
- Data retention and compliance policies

## Communication Plan
- Database design review with development team
- Architecture documentation shared with stakeholders
- Migration plan communicated to operations team
- Performance benchmarks shared with product team
