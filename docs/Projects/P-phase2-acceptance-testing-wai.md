# Write-Ahead Intent: Phase 2 Acceptance Testing

## Intent
Conduct comprehensive acceptance testing for the offline transaction management system to ensure all features meet production requirements and provide a reliable offline-first experience for mobile money agents.

## Rationale
Phase 2 introduces critical offline functionality that must work reliably in challenging network conditions typical in Sub-Saharan Africa. Acceptance testing validates that the system meets business requirements for data integrity, user experience, and operational reliability.

## Expected Outcome
- All Phase 2 features tested and validated
- Performance benchmarks met (99.9% sync success rate, <500ms API response time)
- Offline functionality works across different network conditions
- Data integrity maintained during sync conflicts
- User experience remains smooth during network transitions
- Comprehensive test report with recommendations

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Manual Testing Only**: Considered but insufficient for complex offline scenarios
2. **Unit Tests Only**: Considered but misses integration and end-to-end workflows
3. **Third-party Testing Service**: Considered but internal testing provides better control
4. **Beta User Testing**: Considered but needs to follow comprehensive testing

## Implementation Approach
1. **Test Planning**: Define test scenarios and success criteria
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure testing environments for different network conditions
3. **Automated Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests
4. **Manual Testing**: Conduct user journey and edge case testing
5. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance under various conditions
6. **Security Testing**: Ensure data protection and compliance
7. **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive test reports and recommendations

## Dependencies
- Testing environments (development, staging, production-like)
- Network simulation tools for offline testing
- Performance monitoring tools
- Test data sets representing real-world scenarios
- Mobile devices for real-device testing

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing (80% coverage target)
- **Database Layer**: WatermelonDB operations, schema validation
- **Service Layer**: Sync engine, queue management, network monitoring
- **UI Components**: Form validation, list rendering, error states
- **Utilities**: Error handling, data persistence, validation schemas

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Database + Services**: CRUD operations with sync queue
- **Network + Sync**: Connectivity changes and sync triggers
- **UI + Services**: Real-time balance updates and error handling
- **Background + Main Thread**: Background sync coordination

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- **Offline Transaction Creation**: Complete workflow without network
- **Sync on Reconnection**: Automatic sync when coming online
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling of sync conflicts
- **Background Sync**: Sync during app background/termination
- **Data Persistence**: App restart and device reboot scenarios

## Performance Impact
- **Expected**: Test execution adds ~10-15 minutes to CI/CD pipeline
- **Expected**: Minimal impact on app bundle size (<5% increase)
- **Expected**: No performance degradation in production
- **Risk**: Comprehensive testing may identify performance bottlenecks

## Security Considerations
- **Test Data**: Use anonymized data that doesn't contain real financial information
- **Environment Isolation**: Test environments isolated from production
- **Access Controls**: Test accounts have limited permissions
- **Data Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of test data after execution

## Rollback Plan
- **Test Environment**: Isolated testing doesn't affect production
- **Feature Flags**: Can disable offline features if issues found
- **Data Recovery**: Backup and restore procedures tested
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for issue diagnosis

## Success Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: >80% code coverage across all modules
- **Test Pass Rate**: >95% of automated tests passing
- **Performance**: All performance benchmarks met
- **User Experience**: Smooth operation in offline scenarios
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss in tested scenarios
- **Sync Reliability**: >99.9% sync success rate in test environment

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Test planning and environment setup
- **Week 2**: Unit and integration test implementation
- **Week 3**: End-to-end and performance testing
- **Week 4**: Security testing and final validation

## Documentation Updates
- Test case documentation and execution results
- Performance benchmark reports
- Security assessment findings
- User acceptance testing scenarios
- Known issues and limitations documentation

## Communication Plan
- Daily test execution status updates
- Weekly testing progress reports to stakeholders
- Final acceptance testing report with recommendations
- Bug reports and issue tracking updates
- Go/no-go decision communication
